# Individual Contributors

These titles describe seniority along four main axes: domain knowledge, teaching and mentoring, culture and leadership, and customer success. Most industry ladders focus almost entirely on the first of these four, and expect anyone showing signs of good mentoring or leadership to move directly into management. This approach often takes very capable, happy engineers and turns them into mediocre, unhappy managers. That's bad for everyone involved.
